Heap sort algorithm was used to sort the digit array. Now, the list is traversed and 2 numbers are constructed. Comparisons are made and the result is obtained by the sum of largest of 2 numbers.

TIME COMPLEXITY:

The time complexity will be O(nlogn) as of Heap sort algorithm.


SPACE COMPLEXITY:

The Space complexity will be O(n) as the construction of numbers grow as the linear size of input.
