To increase the efficiency of the program, Binary search method is implemented as half the elements will be eliminated everytime which will lead to fewer number of iterations.

TIME COMPLEXITY:

The time complexity will be O(logn) as of Binary Search Algorithm


SPACE COMPLEXITY:

The Space complexity will be O(1) as constant space is used to find the mid value.
