Maintaining three indexes to keep track of low, middle and high values. After that, traversing the arr and depending on the value of 1's index, swapping the values and updating the corresponding index.

I created three lists to store 0,1 and 2 respectively and later merge them together to give output list. Space complexity of the code is O(n).
